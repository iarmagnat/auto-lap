# Auto LMP vagrant script

### Simply run `script.sh` to behold its magic

I did not create customized error messages for 3 reasons:
- Bash standard errors are plenty clear enough as it is
- The errors I could have created wound not have been localized, whereas Bash's are.
- Bash error management is, depending on the point of view, somewhere between a weird and unusual syntax and a huge pain in the a** to do.

<hr>

I realy don't know how to make the script stop with ctrl + c  so... Sorry it doesn't work.

This is actually quite lame.
